CiviCRM Event Calendar Hex Color
Hi

I am trying to set hex color to a CiviCRM event calendar by events types. The Event Calendar Setting in CiviCRM only changes the Show Events Calendar it does not control the color of the calendar in the view that I configured.

Also, Is it possible to change the font color of the hyperlink in a calendar? The Show Events Calendar also does not wrap text.

Using Drupal 7
